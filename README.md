Computer Assistant
==================

This is an application that allows the integration of a computer with home assistant via MQTT.

It is still in __very__ early development, but already supports some homeassistant entities, such as `switch`, `sensor`, `number` and `button`

It is configured through the [config.yaml](./config.yaml) file, but it's not yet well documented.
